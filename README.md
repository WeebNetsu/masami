Monika After Story (on) Android - Mod Installer

##### NOTE: This app is still in development! It may break, not work and will be incomplete.

This app was created specifically to make the process of installing mods on MAS easier (as seen on [here](https://youtu.be/3SnwZwhXnNE?t=532)).

## Community

## Contributing

If you know any Dart/Flutter, feel free to contribute to the code, I am a sole developer with many other projects I need to maintain, so I cannot promise fast updates, but with help from the community it can be much faster!
